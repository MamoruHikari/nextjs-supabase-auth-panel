# Next.js + Supabase Auth Panel

A modern user authentication and management panel built using **Next.js**, **Supabase**, **React**, and **PostgreSQL**. This project is based on a ready-to-use Next.js + Supabase boilerplate and serves as an admin panel to manage users.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Next.js** â€“ React-based framework for fast and modern web apps.
- **Supabase** â€“ Backend-as-a-service for authentication, database (PostgreSQL), and API.
- **React** â€“ For building UI components.
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ The relational database powering Supabase.
- **Supabase Auth** â€“ Handles secure user sign-up, login, and session management.
- **Supabase Database** â€“ Used to store additional user info via the `users` table.

> **Note**: This project does **not** use Tailwind CSS or any other CSS framework.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- User sign-up & login functionality
- Email/password authentication via Supabase
- Redirects and session handling with `supabase-js`
- Admin dashboard to view user records
- PostgreSQL database integration for storing user data
- Server-side data fetching using Supabase client

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-supabase-auth-panel.git
cd nextjs-supabase-auth-panel
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file at the root of your project and add your Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

You can find these in the Supabase dashboard under **Project Settings > API**.

### 4. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

* The project uses the **Next.js App Router** to manage routes.
* **Supabase Auth** handles sign-up, login, and session persistence (via cookies).
* Once a user logs in, they are redirected to a dashboard page (`/admin/users`) which fetches data from a `users` table in Supabase.
* User actions such as inserting new users or reading data are performed using Supabase's JavaScript client (`@supabase/supabase-js`).
* Supabaseâ€™s PostgreSQL database stores all user data securely and in real time.
* The project was built from a **Next.js + Supabase boilerplate**, customized to meet specific UI/UX and functionality requirements.
